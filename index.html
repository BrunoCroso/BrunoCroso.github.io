                        <p align="justify">	Hello, I'm Bruno Croso, a statistician who recently graduated from the University of São Paulo (USP). During my time at the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics, I dedicated myself to making the most of what it could provide me. With that in mind, as the top student in my class at the university, I actively pursued experiences in various domains, including junior enterprises, student weeks, and extension groups, often taking on leadership roles. Moreover, in order to explore realms beyond my institute, expand my academic horizons and contribute positively to society, I had the privilege of participating in academic research focused on improving Fake News detection models. Additionally, for the same reasons, I dedicated a year to volunteer as a mathematics teacher. Those experiences made me develop a deep passion for learning, as well as the desire to become a data scientist able to make a positive impact on the world.</p>
                        <p align="justify"> Going beyond academic boundaries, I constantly seek new challenges and experiences. In my free time, I enjoy playing the piano and staying active through sports like canoeing and weight training. Furthermore, greatly influenced by an exchange carried out in high school, I have developed a profound love for traveling and immersing myself in the culture of different countries worldwide.</p>

                                I was involved in an academic research under the guidance of Professor Roseli de Deus Lopes, investigating the incorporation of textual features into Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for fake news detection on the social network X (formerly Twitter). Our research examined how integrating representations of user profile content and interactions involved in the spread of news into the graph's nodes influenced model performance. Additionally, we explored the impact of different embedders for generating these representations, comparing the widely-used static text encoder GloVe with the contextual encoder BERTweet. Finally, we also investigated whether upsampling combined with feature noise injection could enhance results, applying the NEFTune method with noise amplitudes of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25. All possible feature combinations were trained using the Graph Attention Network (GAT) architecture and the results were evaluated using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired differences.
